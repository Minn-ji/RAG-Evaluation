# RAG Evaluation

This project provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. It includes a variety of metrics and tools to assess the performance of different components of a RAG pipeline, including retrieval, generation, and overall system performance.

## Features

*   **Modular Evaluation:** Evaluate retrieval, generation, and overall RAG performance independently.
*   **Custom Metrics:** Implement and use custom metrics alongside standard ones.
*   **Benchmarking:** Tools for benchmarking different RAG configurations.
*   **Data-driven Evaluation:** Use custom datasets for evaluation.

This project is designed to be extensible, allowing you to add new metrics and evaluation workflows to suit your specific needs.
